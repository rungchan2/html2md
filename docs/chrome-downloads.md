### acceptDanger()

```typescript
chrome.downloads.acceptDanger(
  downloadId: number,
): Promise<void>
```

Prompt the user to accept a dangerous download. Can only be called from a visible context (tab, window, or page/browser action popup). Does not automatically accept dangerous downloads. If the download is accepted, then an[`onChanged`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#event-onChanged)event will fire, otherwise nothing will happen. When all the data is fetched into a temporary file and either the download is not dangerous or the danger has been accepted, then the temporary file is renamed to the target filename, the`state`changes to 'complete', and[`onChanged`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#event-onChanged)fires.  

#### Parameters

  - downloadId  
  number

The identifier for the[`DownloadItem`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem).  

#### Returns

  - Promise\<void\>

### cancel()

```typescript
chrome.downloads.cancel(
  downloadId: number,
): Promise<void>
```

Cancel a download. When`callback`is run, the download is cancelled, completed, interrupted or doesn't exist anymore.  

#### Parameters

  - downloadId  
  number

The id of the download to cancel.  

#### Returns

  - Promise\<void\>  
Chrome 96+  

### download()

```typescript
chrome.downloads.download(
  options: DownloadOptions,
): Promise<number>
```

Download a URL. If the URL uses the HTTP\[S\] protocol, then the request will include all cookies currently set for its hostname. If both`filename`and`saveAs`are specified, then the Save As dialog will be displayed, pre-populated with the specified`filename`. If the download started successfully,`callback`will be called with the new[`DownloadItem`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem)'s`downloadId`. If there was an error starting the download, then`callback`will be called with`downloadId=undefined`and[`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError)will contain a descriptive string. The error strings are not guaranteed to remain backwards compatible between releases. Extensions must not parse it.  

#### Parameters

  - options  
  [DownloadOptions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadOptions)

What to download and how.  

#### Returns

  - Promise\<number\>  
Chrome 96+  

### erase()

```typescript
chrome.downloads.erase(
  query: DownloadQuery,
): Promise<number[]>
```

An[`onErased`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#event-onErased)event will fire for each[`DownloadItem`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem)that matches`query`, then`callback`will be called.  

#### Parameters

  - query  
[DownloadQuery](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadQuery)  

#### Returns

  - Promise\<number\[\]\>

### getFileIcon()

```typescript
chrome.downloads.getFileIcon(
  downloadId: number,
  options?: GetFileIconOptions,
): Promise<string | undefined>
```

Retrieve an icon for the specified download. For new downloads, file icons are available after the[`onCreated`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#event-onCreated)event has been received. The image returned by this function while a download is in progress may be different from the image returned after the download is complete. Icon retrieval is done by querying the underlying operating system or toolkit depending on the platform. The icon that is returned will therefore depend on a number of factors including state of the download, platform, registered file types and visual theme. If a file icon cannot be determined,[`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError)will contain an error message.  

#### Parameters

This method requires the`"downloads.open"`permission in addition to the`"downloads"`permission. An[`onChanged`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#event-onChanged)event fires when the item is opened for the first time. This method can only be called in response to a user gesture.  

#### Parameters

  - downloadId

## Events

### onChanged

```typescript
chrome.downloads.onChanged.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

When any of a[`DownloadItem`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem)'s properties except`bytesReceived`and`estimatedEndTime`changes, this event fires with the`downloadId`and an object containing the properties that changed.  

#### Parameters

  - callback  
  function

  The`callback`parameter looks like:  

  ```typescript
  (downloadDelta: DownloadDelta) => void
  ```

  <br />

    - downloadDelta  
[DownloadDelta](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadDelta)  

### onCreated

```typescript
chrome.downloads.onCreated.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

This event fires with the[`DownloadItem`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem)object when a download begins.  

#### Parameters

  - callback  
  function

  The`callback`parameter looks like:  

  ```typescript
  (downloadItem: DownloadItem) => void
  ```

  <br />

    - downloadItem  
[DownloadItem](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem)  

### onDeterminingFilename

```typescript
chrome.downloads.onDeterminingFilename.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

During the filename determination process, extensions will be given the opportunity to override the target[`DownloadItem.filename`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#property-DownloadItem-filename). Each extension may not register more than one listener for this event. Each listener must call`suggest`exactly once, either synchronously or asynchronously. If the listener calls`suggest`asynchronously, then it must return`true`. If the listener neither calls`suggest`synchronously nor returns`true`, then`suggest`will be called automatically. The[`DownloadItem`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem)will not complete until all listeners have called`suggest`. Listeners may call`suggest`without any arguments in order to allow the download to use`downloadItem.filename`for its filename, or pass a`suggestion`object to`suggest`in order to override the target filename. If more than one extension overrides the filename, then the last extension installed whose listener passes a`suggestion`object to`suggest`wins. In order to avoid confusion regarding which extension will win, users should not install extensions that may conflict. If the download is initiated by[`download`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#method-download)and the target filename is known before the MIME type and tentative filename have been determined, pass`filename`to[`download`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#method-download)instead.  

#### Parameters

  - callback  
  function

  The`callback`parameter looks like:  

  ```typescript
  (downloadItem: DownloadItem, suggest: function) => void
  ```

  <br />

    - downloadItem  
    [DownloadItem](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-DownloadItem)
    - suggest  
    function

    The`suggest`parameter looks like:  

    ```typescript
    (suggestion?: FilenameSuggestion) => void
    ```

    <br />

      - suggestion  
[FilenameSuggestion](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/downloads#type-FilenameSuggestion)optional  

### onErased

```typescript
chrome.downloads.onErased.addListener(
